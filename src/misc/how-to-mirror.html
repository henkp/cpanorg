<h1>
    How to mirror CPAN
</h1>
<p>
    There are several ways to mirror CPAN depending upon what you want to
    achieve.
</p>

<h2>
    How do I create a private or offline mirror?
</h2>
<p>
    <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Mini/bin/minicpan">minicpan</a>
    from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Mini/">CPAN::Mini</a> is the
    best tool for this. Also look at <a href=
    "http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Mini-Inject/">CPAN::Mini::Inject</a>
    which allows you to add your own modules into your private mirror.
</p>


<h2>
    Requirements for a full / public mirror
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Good internet connectivity
    </li>
    <li>Around 1GB of storage space for just the current modules.
    </li>
    <li>Around [% 
      cpan_gb = cpan_stats.disk_usage.gb;
      cpan_gb = cpan_gb.remove('\..*');
      cpan_gb = cpan_gb + 2;
      cpan_gb %]GB of storage space for the full mirror.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>It's highly recommended that you also subscribe to the announcements-only
   <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.mirrors">cpan-mirrors
   mailing list</a> by emailing cpan-mirrors-subscribe at perl.org.
</p>

<h2>
    Tools
</h2>
<p>
    <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Mini/">CPAN::Mini</a> provides
    you with a minimal mirror of <a href="http://www.cpan.org">CPAN</a> (the
    latest version of all modules). This makes working offline easy, it is the
    best tool of you are running a private mirror.
</p>
<p>
    <em>New:</em> <a href="#Instant_mirroring">rrr-client</a> allows
    instant mirroring, and should be used on official public mirrors where
    possible. See instant mirroring <a href=
    "#Instant_mirroring">instructions</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a> is the best tool if you need to
    mirror the whole of CPAN or if you are providing a public mirror. Rsync
    <a href="#rsync">Instructions</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Only use FTP if these other methods are absolutely impossible. Never mirror
    with HTTP - you will end up with a million duplicate files in tens of
    gigabytes.
</p>

<h2>
    Which CPAN Mirror should I use?
</h2>

<p>
    Please note that after 15 years of service to the Perl community,
    FUnet is no longer the master CPAN mirror.  If you update from
    funet.fi you should update your mirroring source.
</p>

<p>
    You can find your nearest rsync enabled site on <a href=
    "http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html">http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html</a>, or use
    <a href="http://www.cpan.org/indices/mirrors.json">mirrors.json</a>
    especially if you are building a tool which lets the user select a mirror.
</p>

<p>
    You can also sync from <code>rsync://cpan-rsync.perl.org/CPAN/</code> (the
    "tier 1 mirrors"), though you currently might get better
    performance from a "local" mirror.
</p>

<h2>
    <a name="rsync" id="rsync">Using rsync</a>
</h2>
<p>
    Please limit to once or twice a day. For more frequent updates please see
    <a href="#Instant_mirroring">Instant mirroring</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <em>On Unix systems</em>
</p>
<pre>
/usr/bin/rsync -av --delete cpan-rsync.perl.org::CPAN /project/CPAN/
</pre>
<p>
    Using 'crontab' you can make rsync run once a day, for example<br>
    <tt>4 40 * * * sleep $(expr $RANDOM \% 7200); /usr/bin/rsync -av --delete
    cpan-rsync.perl.org::CPAN /project/CPAN/</tt><br>
    The "sleep $(...);" statement makes the command delay up to 2 hours before
    running rsync; the advantage of this is that you (and everybody else) won't
    access the mirror at the same time!
</p>
<p>
    If you have a problem with permissions (files are created with mode
    <tt>-rw-------</tt>), set <tt>umask</tt> in your cronjob :<br>
    <tt>4 40 * * * umask 022 ; sleep ... ; /usr/bin/rsync ...</tt><br>
    The <tt>umask 022</tt> allows rsync to set proper permissions for
    files and directories.
</p>
<p>
    <em>On Windows systems</em>
</p>
<pre>
C:\Program Files\Rsync\rsync -av --delete cpan-rsync.perl.org::CPAN /project/CPAN/
</pre>
<p>
    Using the 'AT' tool, you can schedule rsync to run daily, for example:<br>
    <tt>AT 20:00 /every:M,T,W,Th,F,S,Su "C:\Program Files\Rsync\rsync -av
    --delete cpan-rsync.perl.org::CPAN /project/CPAN/"</tt><br>
</p>


<h2 id="Public_mirror">
    How do I create a public mirror?
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Consider <a href="#Instant_mirroring">Instant mirroring</a>, required
    if you wish to be a tier 1 mirror, or..
    </li>
    <li>rsync once a day
    </li>
    <li>Provide (in order of preference) rsync, HTTP and/or FTP public access
    </li>
    <li>To be added to <a href=
    "http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html">http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html</a> and
    <a href="http://www.cpan.org/indices/mirrors.json">mirrors.json</a> please
    complete the <a href="http://www.cpan.org/MIRRORED.BY">template</a>
    confirming the public accessible URLs to your mirror: rsync, ftp, http and
    email it to cpan@perl.org.
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>
    <a name="Instant_mirroring" id="Instant_mirroring">Instant mirroring</a>
</h2>
<p>
    If you want "instant" updates (updates from PAUSE within a few
    minutes or less) and you are willing to put a little more effort into running the mirror you can
    <a href="https://github.com/perlorg/cpanorg/wiki/Instant-update-mirroring">join the instant mirroring
    trial</a>.
</p>
<p>
    It is used by more than 60 mirrors already, generally without
    issue but is still considered "under testing".  Instant mirroring
    is required for all Tier 1 mirrors (so cpan-rsync.perl.org stays
    in sync across mirrors).
</p>
